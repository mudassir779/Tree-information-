                  Tree trimming is the process of removing dead or overgrown branches and limbs from your tree. This will help improve airflow throughout the tree, reducing stress on each branch and preventing structural damage. It's an essential service that should be done each year to ensure healthy growth and reduce the risk of disease.

                  Tree pruning is the process of selectively removing live branches and limbs. This helps promote healthy growth, allowing more sunlight to reach each branch. It also improves air circulation throughout the tree and maintains its natural shape. Pruning should be done every three years or as needed to keep your trees in peak condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Young trees also benefit from regular pruning to encourage strong, healthy growth. Our arborists can help you determine the best tree care plan for your young trees to ensure they have a long and healthy life.
